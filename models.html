<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
     This is the report of Manoj Ghimire as a web developer. It includes 
     his experience as web developer. Likewise, why the GUI
    (Graphical User Interface) design decisions had he chosen
     to make the pages. The wireframes that he designed were included
    in this report to better understand his process and idea.
     Why he preferred flex rather than the float properties to put the
    contents. This report has also included the testing 
    screenshot of both Html and CSS from online validators.
     And the conclusion
    part along with limitations and the reference.
</p>
<h2>
    GUI and Flexbox
</h2>
<p>
     Graphical User Interface is a type of user interface that allows
      user to know the item more easily and rapidly as there
    is the symbols or icons used for the same item rather than writing
     the text (text-based user interface.) It is very useful
    to old age people of lower vision sight and uneducated people who 
    can identify easily with the icons used.<br><br>
     Flexbox and float can do the same things by applying different CSS
      properties. But flexbox is new technological model and
    allows the easy align and distribution of items in the container 
    rather than the float. It can easily arrange the order,
    maintain height and width of the contents with simple numbering 
    rather than assigning for all of them particularly and in
    more difficult way. While float is also useful in making bigger
     pictures rather than flex. Therefore, both are good at their
    own things and we should use both at right place for suitable 
    designs.

    <h2>Group Work And Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
         We (me, Tsering Khando Lama, Nischal Sapkota) had worked
          in team for designing and it was very helpful. Working in a group
        flourish creativity. Every person is good at something. When we 
        work in group, ideas are shared and best idea will be introduced.
        While we work as a team, we made different and best designs. 
        Works were also done in little time. Also, the innovation was
        improved because of wider thinking came from different members 
        of a team. I found that teamwork helps us to solve difficult
        problems. Main benefit of working in group is it produces better
         results which is accepted by everybody.<br><br>
         In this first term of BSC Computing first year I have learned to design
          the different types of webpages and make them very
        interesting by adding different animations and features which was just 
        the imagination to develop the web page. I had designed
        a very interesting page of my best friend and family using different 
        applications on 14 April which was the new year in our
        country and I was very glad by getting very pleasant replies with lots 
        of thanks which was only possible with the web development.
